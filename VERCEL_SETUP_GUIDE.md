# Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue
Vercel is configured to use "client" as the root directory, but we removed that directory. The React app is now in the root directory.

## Solution
You need to update the Vercel project settings:

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard
1. Visit https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your "interlock" project
3. Click on the project

### Step 2: Update Project Settings
1. Go to **Settings** tab
2. Scroll down to **Build & Development Settings**
3. Find **Root Directory** setting
4. **Change it from "client" to "." (or leave it empty)**
5. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Redeploy
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **Redeploy** on your latest deployment
3. Or push a new commit to trigger automatic deployment

## Alternative: Use Vercel CLI
If you have Vercel CLI installed:
```bash
vercel --prod
```
This will prompt you to update the root directory setting.

## Current Project Structure
```
/ (root)
├── src/           # React source files
├── public/        # Public assets (index.html)
├── package.json   # Dependencies and scripts
├── vercel.json    # Vercel configuration
└── ... (other files)
```

The React app is now in the root directory, not in a subdirectory.
