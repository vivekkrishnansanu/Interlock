# Salary Advance Deduction System - Demo

## Overview
The salary advance system automatically deducts advance amounts from employee salaries over the specified period. No approval workflow is needed - all advances are automatically approved and uploaded.

## How It Works

### 1. Advance Request Process
- Employee requests advance with amount and deduction period
- System automatically approves the request
- Monthly deduction amount is calculated: `Advance Amount รท Deduction Period`

### 2. Automatic Deduction Calculation
- System tracks months elapsed since advance start date
- Calculates total amount already deducted
- Determines remaining amount to be deducted
- Applies deduction to current month's salary

### 3. Integration with Salary Calculation
- Advance deductions are automatically subtracted from net pay
- Displayed in Daily Logs and Monthly Summaries
- No manual intervention required
